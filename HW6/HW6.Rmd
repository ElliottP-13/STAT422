# Problem 1
## Statement
Let $X_1,...,X_n$ be a random sample from the distribution with the following pdf: $$f(x;\theta) = \theta x^{\theta -1}I_{(0,1)}(x), \text{ where } \theta > 0$$

  a. Find a complete sufficient statistic for $\theta$  
  b. Using your answer in part (a), explain why $\displaystyle \prod_{i = 1}^n X_i$ is also a sufficient statistic for $\theta$. 
   
## Solution












# Problem 2
## Statement

A real estate firm wants to estimate the rate of new houses sold in a week in Bozeman. Assume $X_1,...,X_n$ is a random sample of weekly house sales in Bozeman, where each $X_i$ is a Poisson random variable with mean $\mu$. The observed number of new houses sold per week for 5 randomly chosen weeks, were 2, 3, 3, 4, and 6. Find the best unbiased estimator (i.e., the UMVUE) of $\mu$ and its estimate. Show all work, and carefully explain why it is the UMVUE.    

## Solution
